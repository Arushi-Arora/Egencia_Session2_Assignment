CREATE AN IMMUTABLE CLASS IN JAVA:
The following points are to be followed to create an immutable class in java :-
1. Declare the class as final so it canÕt be extended.
2. Make all fields private so that direct access is not allowed.
3. Don't provide setter methods for variables
Example of a custom immutable java class:

publicÊfinalÊclassÊContacts {

     private final String fname;	//the data member is final
        private final String number;	//the data member is final

        private Contacts (String name, String mobile) {	//constructor
          	this.name=name;
          	this.mobile=mobile;
      	}
	
	//No setters present in the given class

      	public String getFirstName(){	//getter
        		return this.fname;
        }

      	public String getNumber(){	//getter
        		return this.mobile;
      	}
}
